<section class="usage">

## Usage

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/no-redeclare -->

```javascript
var Function = require( '@stdlib/function/ctor' );
```

#### Function( \[...argNames,] body )

Returns a new [function][mdn-function] object.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/no-redeclare -->

```javascript
var greet = new Function( 'name', 'return "Hello, "+name+"!"' );

var v = greet( 'Jane' );
// returns 'Hello, Jane!'
```

Argument names must be strings corresponding to valid JavaScript parameters (i.e., a plain identifier, or, in environments supporting such parameters, a rest parameter or destructured parameter, optionally with a default).

## Notes

-   In pre-ES2015 environments, only plain identifiers (without defaults) are valid JavaScript parameters.
-   Creating `Function` objects with the `Function` constructor is less efficient than declaring a function via a function expression or a function statement.
-   The `Function` constructor can be invoked without the `new` operator (using `new` and not using `new` both return a new `Function` object).
-   The `Function` constructor creates functions which execute in the **global scope**. Hence, created functions **cannot** access variables local to the scope in which functions were created.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/no-redeclare -->

```javascript
var Function = require( '@stdlib/function/ctor' );

var add = new Function( 'x', 'y', 'return x + y' );

var v = add( 1, 2 );
// returns 3
